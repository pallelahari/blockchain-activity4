Extra safety/UX touches:
- Validate recipient address using viem.getAddress() (throws on invalid address).
- Disable Send button while a transaction is in flight to avoid double sending.
- LocalStorage saves selected team and token address for convenience.

Issues & fixes:
- Initially saw "Returned no data (0x)" â€” fixed by verifying token address and ensuring chain was switched in MetaMask.
- If watchContractEvent doesn't fire in some browsers, app still provides a manual Refresh button.
